- Have bigger data set which means more delivery service companies and more extensive description for each food item, which will make output of the search tool more relevant
- Use stronger search engine tools, such as implementing N-gram indexing. Potential usage of whoosh library, which can be used to sort by priority que (i.e. higher match higher rank in the output)
